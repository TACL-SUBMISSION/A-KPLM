TARGETANCHOR focused on decomposition of a complex question into several sub-questions.
In addition, a number of researchers have built systems to take reading comprehension examinations designed to evaluate children's reading levels (Charniak et al, 2000; Hirschman et al, 1999; Ng et al, 2000; Riloff and Thelen, 2000; TARGETANCHOR).
The so-called "definition" or "other" questions at recent TREC evaluations TARGETANCHOR serve as good examples: "good answers" to these questions include interesting "nuggets" about a particular person, organization, entity, or event.
Further improvements may be possible by using a sentence splitter instead of windows of fixed length, anaphora resolution, clustering of similar snippets to avoid ranking them separately, and identifying additional n-gram attributes by bootstrapping TARGETANCHOR.
For example, TARGETANCHOR, Miller, Herschman, and Kelly (1978) on the LADDER system, and Biermann, Ballard, and Sigmon (1983) reported software failures at the rates of approximately 5, 2, and 2 percents, respectively.
Automatic pattern derivation is more appealing TARGETANCHOR.
TARGETANCHOR also use bootstrapping, and learn simple surface patterns for extracting binary relations from the Web.
QA is different than search engines in two aspects: (i) instead of a string of keyword search terms, the query is a natural language question, necessitating question parsing, (ii) instead of a list of documents or URLs, a list of candidate answers at phrase level or sentence level are expected to be returned in response to a query, hence the need for text processing beyond keyword indexing, typically supported by Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Information Extraction (IE) (Chinchor and Marsh
