TARGETANCHOR focused on decomposition of a complex question into several sub-questions.
In addition, a number of researchers have built systems to take reading comprehension examinations designed to evaluate children's reading levels (Charniak et al, 2000; Hirschman et al, 1999; Ng et al, 2000; Riloff and Thelen, 2000; TARGETANCHOR).
TARGETANCHOR present an alternative ontology for type preference and describe a method for using this alternative ontology to extract particular answers using surface text patterns.
Quarc TARGETANCHOR utilizes manually generated rules that selects a sentence deemed to contain the answer based on a combination of syntactic similarity and semantic correspondence (i.e., semantic categories of nouns).
We pick the five vectors whose confidence score for the category of definitions is highest, and report the corresponding snippets; in effect, we use the SVM as a ranker, rather than a classifier; see also TARGETANCHOR.
For example, TARGETANCHOR, Miller, Herschman, and Kelly (1978) on the LADDER system, and Biermann, Ballard, and Sigmon (1983) reported software failures at the rates of approximately 5, 2, and 2 percents, respectively.
Clarification dialogues can be applied to negotiate with users about the intent of their questions TARGETANCHOR.
Automatic pattern derivation is more appealing TARGETANCHOR.
In many cases, they involve dealing with several events, or identifying and rea- soning about certain relations among events which are only partially stated in the source documents (such as temporal and causal ones), all of which makes the pattern-based approach less suitable for the task (TARGETANCHOR, Soricut and Brill, 2004).
Moreover, the proof relies on
