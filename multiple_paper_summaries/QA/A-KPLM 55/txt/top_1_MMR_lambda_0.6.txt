TARGETANCHOR focused on decomposition of a complex question into several sub-questions.
In addition, a number of researchers have built systems to take reading comprehension examinations designed to evaluate children's reading levels (Charniak et al, 2000; Hirschman et al, 1999; Ng et al, 2000; Riloff and Thelen, 2000; TARGETANCHOR).
Lexical synonymy (She esteemed him highly vs. She respected him greatly), syntactic variation (John paid the bill vs. The bill was paid by John), overlapping meanings (Anna turned at Elm vs. Anna rounded the corner at Elm), and other phenomena interact to produce a broad range of choices for most language generation tasks (Hirst, 2003; TARGETANCHOR; Kozlowski et al, 2003).
Concurrently, the LSA module evaluates the quality of the student contributions, and in the tutor-initiative mode, the dialog move generator selects one or a combination of specific dialog moves that is both conversationally and pedagogically appropriate (Person et al 2000; Person et al 2001).
It may also partially reflect the intention of the current TREC QA Track that the question series introduced in TREC QA 2004 TARGETANCHOR simulate an interaction with a human, thus expected to arrive one at a time.
3.1 Feature Representation Our feature representation was designed to capture the information sources that prior work (Hirschman et al, 1999; Charniak et al, 2000; TARGETANCHOR) used in their computations or rules.
Further improvements may be possible by using a sentence splitter instead of windows of fixed length, anaphora resolution, clustering of similar snippets to avoid ranking them separately, and identifying additional
