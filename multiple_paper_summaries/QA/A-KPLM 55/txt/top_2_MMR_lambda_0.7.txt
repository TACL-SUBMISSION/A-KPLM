TARGETANCHOR focused on decomposition of a complex question into several sub-questions.
In addition, a number of researchers have built systems to take reading comprehension examinations designed to evaluate children's reading levels (Charniak et al, 2000; Hirschman et al, 1999; Ng et al, 2000; Riloff and Thelen, 2000; TARGETANCHOR).
QA is different than search engines in two aspects: (i) instead of a string of keyword search terms, the query is a natural language question, necessitating question parsing, (ii) instead of a list of documents or URLs, a list of candidate answers at phrase level or sentence level are expected to be returned in response to a query, hence the need for text processing beyond keyword indexing, typically supported by Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Information Extraction (IE) (Chinchor and Marsh 1998, Hovy, Hermjakob and Lin 2001, TARGETANCHOR).
Concurrently, the LSA module evaluates the quality of the student contributions, and in the tutor-initiative mode, the dialog move generator selects one or a combination of specific dialog moves that is both conversationally and pedagogically appropriate (Person et al 2000; Person et al 2001).
3.1 Feature Representation Our feature representation was designed to capture the information sources that prior work (Hirschman et al, 1999; Charniak et al, 2000; TARGETANCHOR) used in their computations or rules.
To better facilitate user information needs, recent trends in QA research have shifted towards complex, context-based, and interactive question answering (Voorhees, 2001; TARGETANCHOR; Harabagiu et al, 2005).
