TARGETANCHOR focused on decomposition of a complex question into several sub-questions.
There are many previous work on paraphrase examples extraction or combining them with some applications such as information retrieval and question answering (Agichtein et al, 2001; Florence et al, 2003; TARGETANCHOR; Tomuro, 2003; Lin and Pantel, 2001;), information extraction (Shinyama et al, 2002; Shinyama and Sekine, 2003), machine translation (Hiroshi et al, 2003; Zhang and Yamamoto, 2003), multi-document (Barzilay et al, 2003).
There, a system that attempted a minimal understanding of both the question and the answer candidates, by translating them into their logical forms and using an inference engine, achieved a notably higher score than any surface-based system (Moldavan et al, 2002; Harabagiu et al, 2003).
In addition, a number of researchers have built systems to take reading comprehension examinations designed to evaluate children's reading levels (Charniak et al, 2000; Hirschman et al, 1999; Ng et al, 2000; Riloff and Thelen, 2000; TARGETANCHOR).
3.1 Feature Representation Our feature representation was designed to capture the information sources that prior work (Hirschman et al, 1999; Charniak et al, 2000; TARGETANCHOR) used in their computations or rules.
To better facilitate user information needs, recent trends in QA research have shifted towards complex, context-based, and interactive question answering (Voorhees, 2001; TARGETANCHOR; Harabagiu et al, 2005).
Concurrently, the LSA module evaluates the quality of the student contributions, and in the tutor-initiative mode, the dialog move generator selects one or a combination of specific dialog moves that is both conversationally and pedagogically appropriate (Person
