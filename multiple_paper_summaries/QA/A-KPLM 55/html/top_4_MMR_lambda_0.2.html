<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In addition, a number of researchers have built systems to take reading comprehension examinations designed to evaluate children's reading levels (Charniak et al, 2000; Hirschman et al, 1999; Ng et al, 2000; Riloff and Thelen, 2000; TARGETANCHOR). </a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>TARGETANCHOR present an alternative ontology for type preference and describe a method for using this alternative ontology to extract particular answers using surface text patterns. </a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Quarc TARGETANCHOR utilizes manually generated rules that selects a sentence deemed to contain the answer based on a combination of syntactic similarity and semantic correspondence (i.e., semantic categories of nouns). </a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>It may also partially reflect the intention of the current TREC QA Track that the question series introduced in TREC QA 2004 TARGETANCHOR simulate an interaction with a human, thus expected to arrive one at a time. </a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>For example, TARGETANCHOR, Miller, Herschman, and Kelly (1978) on the LADDER system, and Biermann, Ballard, and Sigmon (1983) reported software failures at the rates of approximately 5, 2, and 2 percents, respectively. </a>

<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>We pick the five vectors whose confidence score for the category of definitions is highest, and report the corresponding snippets; in effect, we use the SVM as a ranker, rather than a classifier; see also TARGETANCHOR. </a>
