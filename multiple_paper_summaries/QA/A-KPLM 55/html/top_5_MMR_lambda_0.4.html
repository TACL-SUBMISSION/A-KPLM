<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>There, a system that attempted a minimal understanding of both the question and the answer candidates, by translating them into their logical forms and using an inference engine, achieved a notably higher score than any surface-based system (Moldavan et al, 2002; Harabagiu et al, 2003). </a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The so-called "definition" or "other" questions at recent TREC evaluations TARGETANCHOR serve as good examples: "good answers" to these questions include interesting "nuggets" about a particular person, organization, entity, or event. </a>
