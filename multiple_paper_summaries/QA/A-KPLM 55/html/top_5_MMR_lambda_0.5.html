<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>QA is different than search engines in two aspects: (i) instead of a string of keyword search terms, the query is a natural language question, necessitating question parsing, (ii) instead of a list of documents or URLs, a list of candidate answers at phrase level or sentence level are expected to be returned in response to a query, hence the need for text processing beyond keyword indexing, typically supported by Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Information Extraction (IE) (Chinchor and Marsh 1998, Hovy, Hermjakob and Lin 2001, TARGETANCHOR). </a>
