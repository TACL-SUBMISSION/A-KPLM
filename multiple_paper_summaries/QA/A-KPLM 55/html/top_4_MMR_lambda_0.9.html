<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>There are many previous work on paraphrase examples extraction or combining them with some applications such as information retrieval and question answering (Agichtein et al, 2001; Florence et al, 2003; TARGETANCHOR; Tomuro, 2003; Lin and Pantel, 2001;), information extraction (Shinyama et al, 2002; Shinyama and Sekine, 2003), machine translation (Hiroshi et al, 2003; Zhang and Yamamoto, 2003), multi-document (Barzilay et al, 2003). </a>

<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>There, a system that attempted a minimal understanding of both the question and the answer candidates, by translating them into their logical forms and using an inference engine, achieved a notably higher score than any surface-based system (Moldavan et al, 2002; Harabagiu et al, 2003). </a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>3.1 Feature Representation Our feature representation was designed to capture the information sources that prior work (Hirschman et al, 1999; Charniak et al, 2000; TARGETANCHOR) used in their computations or rules. </a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>4 Evaluation To evaluate our learning approach, we trained AQUAREA$ on the same development set of stories and tested it on the same test set of stories as those used in all past work on the reading comprehension task (Hirschman et al, 1999; Charniak et al, 2000; Riloffand Thelen, 2000; TARGETANCHOR). </a>
