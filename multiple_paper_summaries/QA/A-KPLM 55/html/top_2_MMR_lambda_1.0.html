<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In addition, a number of researchers have built systems to take reading comprehension examinations designed to evaluate children's reading levels (Charniak et al, 2000; Hirschman et al, 1999; Ng et al, 2000; Riloff and Thelen, 2000; TARGETANCHOR). </a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>3.1 Feature Representation Our feature representation was designed to capture the information sources that prior work (Hirschman et al, 1999; Charniak et al, 2000; TARGETANCHOR) used in their computations or rules. </a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>To better facilitate user information needs, recent trends in QA research have shifted towards complex, context-based, and interactive question answering (Voorhees, 2001; TARGETANCHOR; Harabagiu et al, 2005). </a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Concurrently, the LSA module evaluates the quality of the student contributions, and in the tutor-initiative mode, the dialog move generator selects one or a combination of specific dialog moves that is both conversationally and pedagogically appropriate (Person et al 2000; Person et al 2001). </a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>QA is different than search engines in two aspects: (i) instead of a string of keyword search terms, the query is a natural language question, necessitating question parsing, (ii) instead of a list of documents or URLs, a list of candidate answers at phrase level or sentence level are expected to be returned in response to a query, hence the need for text processing beyond keyword indexing, typically supported by Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Information Extraction (IE) (Chinchor and Marsh 1998, Hovy, Hermjakob and Lin 2001, TARGETANCHOR). </a>
