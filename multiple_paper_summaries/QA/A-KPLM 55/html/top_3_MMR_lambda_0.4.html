<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>TARGETANCHOR focused on decomposition of a complex question into several sub-questions. </a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>There are many previous work on paraphrase examples extraction or combining them with some applications such as information retrieval and question answering (Agichtein et al, 2001; Florence et al, 2003; TARGETANCHOR; Tomuro, 2003; Lin and Pantel, 2001;), information extraction (Shinyama et al, 2002; Shinyama and Sekine, 2003), machine translation (Hiroshi et al, 2003; Zhang and Yamamoto, 2003), multi-document (Barzilay et al, 2003). </a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>TARGETANCHOR present an alternative ontology for type preference and describe a method for using this alternative ontology to extract particular answers using surface text patterns. </a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>It may also partially reflect the intention of the current TREC QA Track that the question series introduced in TREC QA 2004 TARGETANCHOR simulate an interaction with a human, thus expected to arrive one at a time. </a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Quarc TARGETANCHOR utilizes manually generated rules that selects a sentence deemed to contain the answer based on a combination of syntactic similarity and semantic correspondence (i.e., semantic categories of nouns). </a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Lexical synonymy (She esteemed him highly vs. She respected him greatly), syntactic variation (John paid the bill vs. The bill was paid by John), overlapping meanings (Anna turned at Elm vs. Anna rounded the corner at Elm), and other phenomena interact to produce a broad range of choices for most language generation tasks (Hirst, 2003; TARGETANCHOR; Kozlowski et al, 2003). </a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>QA is different than search engines in two aspects: (i) instead of a string of keyword search terms, the query is a natural language question, </a>
