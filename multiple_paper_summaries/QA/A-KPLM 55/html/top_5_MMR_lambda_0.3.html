<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We pick the five vectors whose confidence score for the category of definitions is highest, and report the corresponding snippets; in effect, we use the SVM as a ranker, rather than a classifier; see also TARGETANCHOR. </a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The so-called "definition" or "other" questions at recent TREC evaluations TARGETANCHOR serve as good examples: "good answers" to these questions include interesting "nuggets" about a particular person, organization, entity, or event. </a>
