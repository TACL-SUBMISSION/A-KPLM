<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>TARGETANCHOR focused on decomposition of a complex question into several sub-questions. </a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>There are many previous work on paraphrase examples extraction or combining them with some applications such as information retrieval and question answering (Agichtein et al, 2001; Florence et al, 2003; TARGETANCHOR; Tomuro, 2003; Lin and Pantel, 2001;), information extraction (Shinyama et al, 2002; Shinyama and Sekine, 2003), machine translation (Hiroshi et al, 2003; Zhang and Yamamoto, 2003), multi-document (Barzilay et al, 2003). </a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>QA is different than search engines in two aspects: (i) instead of a string of keyword search terms, the query is a natural language question, necessitating question parsing, (ii) instead of a list of documents or URLs, a list of candidate answers at phrase level or sentence level are expected to be returned in response to a query, hence the need for text processing beyond keyword indexing, typically supported by Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Information Extraction (IE) (Chinchor and Marsh 1998, Hovy, Hermjakob and Lin 2001, TARGETANCHOR). </a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>There, a system that attempted a minimal understanding of both the question and the answer candidates, by translating them into their logical forms and using an inference engine, achieved a notably higher score than any surface-based system (Moldavan et al, 2002; Harabagiu et al, 2003). </a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The so-called "definition" or "other" questions at recent TREC evaluations TARGETANCHOR serve as good examples: "good answers" to these questions include interesting "nuggets" about a particular person, organization, entity, or event. </a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Lexical synonymy (She esteemed him highly vs. She respected him greatly), syntactic variation </a>
