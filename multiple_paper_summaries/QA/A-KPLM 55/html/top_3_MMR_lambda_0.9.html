<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>TARGETANCHOR focused on decomposition of a complex question into several sub-questions. </a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>There are many previous work on paraphrase examples extraction or combining them with some applications such as information retrieval and question answering (Agichtein et al, 2001; Florence et al, 2003; TARGETANCHOR; Tomuro, 2003; Lin and Pantel, 2001;), information extraction (Shinyama et al, 2002; Shinyama and Sekine, 2003), machine translation (Hiroshi et al, 2003; Zhang and Yamamoto, 2003), multi-document (Barzilay et al, 2003). </a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In addition, a number of researchers have built systems to take reading comprehension examinations designed to evaluate children's reading levels (Charniak et al, 2000; Hirschman et al, 1999; Ng et al, 2000; Riloff and Thelen, 2000; TARGETANCHOR). </a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>There, a system that attempted a minimal understanding of both the question and the answer candidates, by translating them into their logical forms and using an inference engine, achieved a notably higher score than any surface-based system (Moldavan et al, 2002; Harabagiu et al, 2003). </a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>3.1 Feature Representation Our feature representation was designed to capture the information sources that prior work (Hirschman et al, 1999; Charniak et al, 2000; TARGETANCHOR) used in their computations or rules. </a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>To better facilitate user information needs, recent trends in QA research have shifted towards complex, context-based, and interactive question answering (Voorhees, 2001; TARGETANCHOR; Harabagiu et al, 2005). </a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Concurrently, the LSA module evaluates the quality of the student contributions, and in the tutor-initiative mode, the dialog move generator selects one or a combination of specific dialog moves that is both conversationally and pedagogically appropriate (Person </a>
