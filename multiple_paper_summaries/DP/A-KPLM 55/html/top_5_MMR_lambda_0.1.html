<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Even though McDonald et al (2006) and Nivre et al (2006) obtained very similar overall scores, a more detailed look at their performance shows clear differences. </a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Cdummy (2005), used relations between IG-based representations encoded within the Turkish Treebank TARGETANCHOR to automatically induce a CCG grammar lexicon for Turkish. </a>

<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Based on results from previous optimization experiments TARGETANCHOR, we use the modified value difference metric (MVDM) to determine distances between instances, and distance-weighted class voting for determining the class of a new instance. </a>

<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>To go language-independent, we did not tune any parameter settings in our model and exclude most of the language-dependent feature set, which provided by the CoNLL TARGETANCHOR. </a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Abstract Recently proposed deterministic classifier-based parsers (TARGETANCHOR; Sagae and Lavie, 2005; Yamada and Matsumoto, 2003) offer attractive alternatives to generative statistical parsers. </a>
