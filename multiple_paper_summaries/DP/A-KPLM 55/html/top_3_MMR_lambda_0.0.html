<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In this year, CoNLL-X shared task TARGETANCHOR focuses on multilingual dependency parsing without taking the language-specific knowledge into account. </a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>While we have presented significant improvements using additional constraints, one may when caching feature extraction during training TARGETANCHOR still takes approximately 10 minutes to train. </a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Our underlying model is a modi ed labelled version of TARGETANCHOR: s(x,y) = summationdisplay (i,j,l)∈y s(i,j,l) = summationdisplay (i,j,l)∈y w·f(i,j,l) 2Note that this is not described in the McDonald papers but implemented in his software. </a>

<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Additionally, we have adopted solutions to overcome problems that have emerged in doing this analysis (such as discontinuous constituents, subordinate clauses, etc. This approach has been used in several projects (Järvinen & Tapanainen, 1998; TARGETANCHOR). </a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Because XDG allows us to write grammars with completely free word order, XDG solving is an NP-complete problem TARGETANCHOR. </a>

<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>For unlabeled exact match, our results are better than any previously reported results, including those of TARGETANCHOR. </a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>It should be noted that the proportion of lost dependencies is about twice as high as the proportion of dependencies that are non-projective in themselves TARGETANCHOR. </a>
