<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Even though McDonald et al (2006) and Nivre et al (2006) obtained very similar overall scores, a more detailed look at their performance shows clear differences. </a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Cdummy (2005), used relations between IG-based representations encoded within the Turkish Treebank TARGETANCHOR to automatically induce a CCG grammar lexicon for Turkish. </a>

<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Abstract Recently proposed deterministic classifier-based parsers (TARGETANCHOR; Sagae and Lavie, 2005; Yamada and Matsumoto, 2003) offer attractive alternatives to generative statistical parsers. </a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>While we have presented significant improvements using additional constraints, one may when caching feature extraction during training TARGETANCHOR still takes approximately 10 minutes to train. </a>

<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>First, in supervised models, a head outward process is modeled (TARGETANCHOR; Collins, 1999). </a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>It should be noted that the proportion of lost dependencies is about twice as high as the proportion of dependencies that are non-projective in themselves TARGETANCHOR. </a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>For unlabeled exact match, our results are better than any previously reported results, including those of TARGETANCHOR. </a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Nevertheless, extending our approach to directed features and contextual features, as in TARGETANCHOR, remains an important direction for future research. </a>
