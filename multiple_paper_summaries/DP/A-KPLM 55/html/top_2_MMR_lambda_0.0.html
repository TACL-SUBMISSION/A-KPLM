<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Our underlying model is a modi ed labelled version of TARGETANCHOR: s(x,y) = summationdisplay (i,j,l)∈y s(i,j,l) = summationdisplay (i,j,l)∈y w·f(i,j,l) 2Note that this is not described in the McDonald papers but implemented in his software. </a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>It involves several extensions that are not present in earlier encoding schemes where dependencies are also indicated through matching pairs of symbols (TARGETANCHOR; Yli-Jyr¨a, 2004a). </a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Indirect support for this assumption can be gained from previous experiments with Swedish data, where almost the same accuracy (85% unlabeled attachment score) has been achieved with a treebank which is much smaller but which contains proper dependency annotation TARGETANCHOR. </a>

<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Because XDG allows us to write grammars with completely free word order, XDG solving is an NP-complete problem TARGETANCHOR. </a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>For example, Johansson and Nugues (2006) and Yuret (2006) are seven ranks higher for Turkish than overall, while TARGETANCHOR are five ranks lower. </a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>This is an interesting test domain because Chinese does not have clearly deifined parts-of-speech, which makes lexical smoothing one of the most natural approaches to achieving reasonable results TARGETANCHOR. </a>

<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Nevertheless, extending our approach to directed features and contextual features, as in TARGETANCHOR, remains an important direction for future research. </a>
