In this year, CoNLL-X shared task TARGETANCHOR focuses on multilingual dependency parsing without taking the language-specific knowledge into account.
While we have presented significant improvements using additional constraints, one may when caching feature extraction during training TARGETANCHOR still takes approximately 10 minutes to train.
By contrast, TARGETANCHOR do not even enforce the tree constraint, i.e. they allow cycles.

Major Grammatical Predicates The ParseTalk model of DG TARGETANCHOR exploits inheritance as a major abstraction mechanism.
Yet, they can be parsed in o-n-three time TARGETANCHOR.
2. N&N2005: The pseudo-projective parser of TARGETANCHOR.
The two participant groups with the highest total score are McDonald et al (2006) and TARGETANCHOR.
Based on results from previous optimization experiments TARGETANCHOR, we use the modified value difference metric (MVDM) to determine distances between instances, and distance-weighted class voting for determining the class of a new instance.
For example, Johansson and Nugues (2006) and Yuret (2006) are seven ranks
