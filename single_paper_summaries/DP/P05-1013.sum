graph transformations for recovering non-projective structures TARGETANCHOR. 
although the parser only derives projective graphs, the fact that graphs are labeled allows non-projective dependencies to be captured using the pseudoprojective approach of . 
recent work by nivre and nilsson introduces a technique where the projectivization transformation is encoded in the non-terminals of constituents during parsing TARGETANCHOR. 
in section 4.2 we use mbl, again with the same settings as TARGETANCHOR, and in section 4.2 we use svm with a polynomial kernel of degree 2. 
for handling non-projective relations, TARGETANCHOR suggested applying a preprocessing step to a dependency parser, which consists in lifting non-projective arcs to their head repeatedly, until the tree becomes pseudo-projective.
