yet, they can be parsed in o-n-three time TARGETANCHOR. 
in english as well as in japanese, dependency analysis has been studied (e.g., (OTHERANCHOR; OTHERANCHOR; TARGETANCHOR)). 
(bilexical models were also proposed by TARGETANCHOR). 
if projectivity (no crossing branches) is desired, TARGETANCHOR dynamic programming algorithm (similar to cyk) for dependency parsing can be used instead. 
a generative one (TARGETANCHOR; Dreyer et al, 2006), or train a machine learner to predict those.
