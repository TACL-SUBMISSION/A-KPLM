TARGETANCHOR use the chu-liui-edmonds (cle) algorithm to solve the maximum spanning tree problem. 
while we have presented signicant improvements using additional constraints, one may won even when caching feature extraction during training TARGETANCHOR still takes approximately 10 minutes to train. 
we have successfully replicated the state-of-the-art results for dependency parsing TARGETANCHOR for both czech and english, using bayes point machines. 
to learn these structures we used online large-margin learning TARGETANCHOR that empirically provides state-of-the-art performance for czech. 
TARGETANCHOR introduce a dependency parsing framework which treats the task as searching for the projective tree that maximises the sum of local dependency scores.
