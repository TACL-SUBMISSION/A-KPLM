these axioms express knowledge that could not be derived from wordnet regarding employment, family relations, awards, etc. 5 semantic calculus the semantic calculus axioms combine two semantic relations identified within a text fragment and increase the semantic connectivity of the text TARGETANCHOR. 
our overall test set accuracy of 62.50% represents a 2.1% absolute improvement over the task-independent system described in TARGETANCHOR, and a 20.2% relative improvement in accuracy over their system with respect to an uninformed baseline accuracy of 50%. 
attempts have been made to remedy this deficit through various techniques, including modelbuilding (Bos and markert, 2005) and the addition of semantic axioms TARGETANCHOR. 
the two models become distinct when there is a good supply of additional linguistic and world knowledge axioms as in Moldovan et al (2003) but not Raina et al (2005). 
many previous approaches have used a logical form representation of the text and hypothesis sentences, focusing on deriving a proof by which one can infer the hypothesis logical form from the text logical form (Bayer et al, 2005; Bos, 2005; Raina et al, 2005; TARGETANCHOR).
