a similar idea by geffet and dagan TARGETANCHOR was proposed forcapturing lexical entailment. 
for example, two verbs willbeconsideredsimilariftheyhavelargecommon sets of modifying subjects, objects, adverbs etc. distributional similarity does not capture directly meaning equivalence and entailment but rather a looser notion of meaning similarity TARGETANCHOR. 
recent attention to knowledge-rich problems such as question answering (Pasca and harabagiu 2001) and textual entailment TARGETANCHOR has encouraged natural language processing researchers to develop algorithms for automatically harvesting shallow semantic resources. 
TARGETANCHOR, who exploited the distributional similarity approach over the web to address the same task as ours, obtained higher precision but substantially lower recall, considering only distributional candidates. 
it was noted recently by TARGETANCHOR that distributional similarity captures a quite loose notion of semantic similarity, as exemplified by the pair country party (identified by lin's similarity measure).
