finally, a few efforts (Akhmatova, 2005; Fowler et al, 2005; TARGETANCHOR) have tried to 42 translate sentences into formulas of first-order logic, in order to test logical entailment with a theorem prover. 
we show comparable results from recent systems based on lexical similarity (Jijkoun, 2005), graph alignment (Haghighi et al, 2005), weighted abduction (Raina et al, 2005), and a mixed system including theorem proving TARGETANCHOR. 
the rte problem as presented in the pascal rte dataset is particularly attractive in that it is a reasonably simple task for human annotators with high inter-annotator agreement (95.1% in one independent labeling TARGETANCHOR), but an extremely challenging task for automated systems. 
for example, two high-accuracy systems are those described in (Tatu and moldovan, 2005), achieving 60.4% accuracy with no task-specific information, and TARGETANCHOR, which achieves 61.2% task-dependent accuracy, i.e. 
attempts have been made to remedy this deficit through various techniques, including modelbuilding TARGETANCHOR and the addition of semantic axioms (Tatu and moldovan, 2005).
