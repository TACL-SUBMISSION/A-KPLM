TARGETANCHOR obtain p(sj|ti) from smoothed relative-frequency estimates in a wordaligned corpus. 
finally, we use pos features to parameterize a distortion model in a limited distortion decoder (TARGETANCHOR; Tillmann and zhang, 2005). 
several strategies to compute these probabilities have been proposed (TARGETANCHOR; Crego et al, 2004), but none of them takes into account the fact that, when it comes to translation, many different inflected forms of words share the same translation. 
more details about the baseline system can be found in (TARGETANCHOR; Zens et al, 2005). 
as described above, TARGETANCHOR and (Koehn et al, 2005) use two different variants of glass-box smoothing (which they call “lexical smoothing”) over the phrasetable, and combine the resulting estimates with pure relativefrequency ones in a loglinear model.
