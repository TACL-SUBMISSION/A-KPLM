unless otherwise noted, the following discussion is generally applicable to alignment template systems TARGETANCHOR as well. 
phrase-based statistical machine translation (smt) systems analyze large quantities of bilingual parallel texts in order to learn translational alignments between pairs of words and phrases in two languages TARGETANCHOR. 
among these models, the basic ones are a translation model pr(e|f) and a target language model pr(e), which can be complemented by reordering models (if the language pairs presents very long alignments in training), word penalty to avoid favoring short sentences, class-based target-language models, etc TARGETANCHOR. 
nonetheless, attempts to incorporate richer linguistic features have generally met with little success TARGETANCHOR. 
unfortunately, recent work has shown that applying statistical parsers to ungrammatical mt output is unreliable at best, with the parser often assigning unreasonable probabilities and incongruent structure (Yamada and knight, 2002; TARGETANCHOR).
