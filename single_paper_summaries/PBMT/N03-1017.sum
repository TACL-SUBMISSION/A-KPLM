using giza++ model 4 alignments and pharaoh TARGETANCHOR, we achieved a bleu score of 0.3035. 
second, phrase translation pairs are extracted from the word aligned corpus TARGETANCHOR. 
for comparison purposes, three additional heuristically-induced alignments are generated for each system: (1) intersection of both directions (aligner(int)); (2) union of both directions (aligner(union)); and (3) the previously bestknown heuristic combination approach called growdiag-final TARGETANCHOR (aligner(gdf)).

TARGETANCHOR mention german 〈es gibt, there is〉 as an example of a good phrase pair which is not a syntactic phrase pair, and report that favoring syntactic phrases does not improve accuracy.
