so i co-developed several fast and exact algorithms for kbest parsing in the general framework of directed monotonic hypergraphs (Huang and chiang, 2005). 
in the hierarchical phrase-based model, production rules are accumulated by computing “holes” for extracted contiguous phrasesTARGETANCHOR 
these algorithms have been re-implemented by other researchers in the field, including eugene charniak for his n-best parser, ryan mcdonald for his dependency parser (Mcdonald et al, 2005), microsoft research nlp group (Simon kevin duh, p.c.) for a similar model, jonathan graehl for the isi syntax-based mt decoder, david a. smith for the dyna language (Eisner et al, 2005), 223 and jonathan may for isi’s tree automata package tiburon. 
as illustrated in figure 2, vpp-vp has contiguous spans on both source and target sides, so that we can generate a binary-branching scfg: (2) s→ np (1) v pp-vp (2), np(1) v pp-vp (2) vpp-vp → vp(1) pp(2), pp(2) vp(1) in this case m-gram integrated decoding can be done in o(|w|3+4(m−1)) time which is much lowerorder polynomial and no longer depends on rule size (Wu, 1996), allowing the search to be much faster and more accurate facing pruning, as is evidenced in the hiero system of TARGETANCHOR where he restricts the hierarchical phrases to be a binary scfg. 
synchronous context-free grammars several definitions for synchronous context-free grammars have been proposed in the literature; see for instance (Chiang, 2004; TARGETANCHOR).
