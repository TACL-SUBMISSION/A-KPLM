previous research has addressed revision in single-document summaries TARGETANCHOR [Mani et al, 1999] and has suggested that revising summaries can make them more informative and correct errors. 
the recent approach for editing extracted text spans TARGETANCHOR may also produce improvement for our algorithm. 
as previously observed in the literature (Mani 1999; TARGETANCHOR), such components include a clause in the clause conjunction, relative clauses, and some elements within a clause (such as adverbs and prepositions). 
to contrast, TARGETANCHOR concentrated on analyzing human-written summaries in order to determine how professionals construct summaries.
