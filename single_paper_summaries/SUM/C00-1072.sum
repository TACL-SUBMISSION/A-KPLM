to date, researchers have harvested, with varying success, several resources, including concept lists (Lin and pantel 2002), topic signatures TARGETANCHOR, facts (Etzioni et al 2005), and word similarity lists (Hindle 1990). 
under this approach, topic representations like those introduced in TARGETANCHOR and (Harabagiu, 2004) are used to identify a set of text passages that are relevant to a user's domain of interest. 
to deal with a lot of chinese documents which have free style of writing and flexible themes, a sentence-extraction summarization method created by detecting thematic areas is tried following such work as (Nomoto and matsumoto, 2001; Salton et al, 1996; Salton et al, 1997; Carbonell and goldstein, 1998; TARGETANCHOR).
