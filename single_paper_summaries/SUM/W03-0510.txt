unigram co-occurrence metric in a recent study TARGETANCHOR, we showed that the recall-based unigram cooccurrence automatic scoring metric correlates highly with human evaluation and has high recall and precision in predicting the statistical significance of results comparing with its human counterpart. 
let us imagine, for instance, that the best metric turns out to be a rouge TARGETANCHOR variant that only considers unigrams to compute similarity. 
it is also notable the study reported in TARGETANCHOR discussing the usefulness and limitations of automatic sentence extraction for text summarization, 23 single document meta summarization algorithm summarization algo. 
these findings are additionally supported by the fact that automatic n-gram-based evaluation measures now being used to assess predominately extractive multi-document summarization systems correlate strongly with human judgments when restricted to the usage of unigrams and bigrams, but correlate weakly when longer n-grams are factored into the equation TARGETANCHOR. 
the issue of subjectivity gains prominence as the compression ratio increases, i.e., the shorter the summary, the larger the number ofcorrect summaries TARGETANCHOR.
