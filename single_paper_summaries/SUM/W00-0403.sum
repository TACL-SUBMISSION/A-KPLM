but the interpretation of the results is not simple; studies (Jing et al 1998; Donaway mather 2000; TARGETANCHOR) 404 computational linguistics volume 28, number 4 show how the same summaries receive different scores under different measures or when compared to different (but presumably equivalent) ideal summaries created by humans. 
evaluation methods we use the relative utility (ru) method TARGETANCHOR to compare our various summaries. 
mead is a publicly available toolkit for multi-document summarization TARGETANCHOR mead.
inspired by rst, TARGETANCHOR endeavored to establish a cross-document structure theory (cst) that is more appropriate for mds. 
sentence extraction techniques (Luhn, 1958; TARGETANCHOR), on the other hand, compute a score for each sentence based on certain features and output the most highly ranked sentences.
