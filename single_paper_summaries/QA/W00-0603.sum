keywords in questions it has been observed in the work of TARGETANCHOR that certain words in a when or where question tend to indicate that the dateline is an ~n~wer sentence to the question. 
we also compared our results across various interrogatives with those previously reported in TARGETANCHOR. 
based on these technologies, TARGETANCHOR improved the humsent accuracy to 40% by applying a set of heuristic rules that assign handcrafted weights to matching words and ne.

in addition, a number of researchers have built systems to take reading comprehension examinations designed to evaluate childrenâ€™s reading levels (Charniak et al, 2000; Hirschman et al, 1999; Ng et al, 2000; TARGETANCHOR; Wang et al, 2000).
