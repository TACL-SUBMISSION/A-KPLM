so far, research in automatic opinion recognition has primarily addressed learning subjective language (wiebe et al, 2004; riloff et al, 2003), identifying opinionated documents (yu and hatzivassiloglou, 2003) and sentences (yu and hatzivassiloglou, 2003; riloff et al, 2003), and discriminating between positive and negative language (pang et al, 2002; morinaga et al, 2002; yu and hatzivassiloglou, 2003; turney and littman, 2003; dave et al, 2003; nasukawa and yi, 2003; popescu and etzioni, 2005; wilson et al, 2005). 
yu and hatzivassiloglou (2003) provide methods for sentence-level analysis and for determining whether a document is subjective or not, but do not combine these two types of algorithms or consider document polarity classification. 
there have been attempts on tackling this so-called document-level subjectivity classification task, with very encouraging results (see yu and hatzivassiloglou (2003) and wiebe et al (2004) for details). 
most of the annotation approaches tackling these issues, however, are aimed at performing classifications at either the document level (pang et al, 2002; turney, 2002), or the sentence or word level (wiebe et al, 2004; yu and hatzivassiloglou, 2003). 
following the insight of yu and hatzivassiloglou (2003), we made the basic and rough assumption that words that appear more often in newspaper editorials and letters to the editor than in non-editorial news articles could be potential opinion-bearing words (even though editorials contain sentences about factual events as well).
