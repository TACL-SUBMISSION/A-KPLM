data TARGETANCHOR describe a dataset of concept-instance pairs extracted automatically from a very large corpus of newspaper articles. 
Mann (2002) and TARGETANCHOR used part of speech patterns to extract a subset of hyponym relations involving proper nouns. 
the precision of the extracted information can be improved significantly by using machine learning methods to filter out noise TARGETANCHOR. 
definition questions following TARGETANCHOR, we select the 50 definition questions from the trec2003 (Voorhees 2003) question set. 
at the same time, research efforts in data acquisition promise to deliver increasingly larger question-answer datasets (Girju et al, 2003; TARGETANCHOR).
